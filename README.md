This repository contains the hw02 for the fall 2016, Stat159 at UC Berkeley.

This project is about generating data for a simple linear regression model in R.

In this repository, I have 4 directories: data, code, images, and report

The data directory is where I stored my data such as the data sheet and coding outputs and environment.  The code directory is where I stored my code in R.  The images directory contains all of the graphics and tables in the report. The report directory contains my report.Rmd and the report.pdf
