This directory contains the all of the data files that I used to work with, primarily in R.

Advertising.csv is the data set that we used for the linear regression model.

eda-output.txt are short codings (generated in R) for the summaries of the TV and Sales columns in the advertising.csv data set.

regression.RData is the working environment that I used to generate the scripts for regression-script.R
